The name of this project is Contact App.

In this project, I developed several features such as adding, deleting, and editing contacts. The user can also search contacts by name. I also added a Delete All button that allows the user to remove all the saved contacts at once.

the list af feature in this app:

.Add contact

.Delete all contacts

.Delete a specific contact

.Edit a specific contact

.Search by name

.Validation

.React Context

.useReducer

To run this project, we need Node.js.
After installing Node.js, check the versions using the following commands:node -v
npm -v

We can use Vite to create a React project.
Open the terminal and run:

npm create vite@latest
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev


In this project, I used React Context API, JSON Server, and useReducer.


One of the reasons I chose this project is its practicality. A contact app is useful for everyone, and most people interact with such apps daily. I also wanted to learn useReducer, because it provides a simple and clean way to handle adding, editing, and deleting items.
